# # Checking the symplecticity of a method

# First, I need to import the packages that will be used in the following code.

import Pkg; Pkg.activate(dirname(@__DIR__)); Pkg.instantiate()

using BSeries
using RootedTrees

# ## The Interesting Part
# Now I can start to define the functions needed for checking the symplecticity of a method.
#
# The ideas mainly come from Sundklakk's master thesis and are only changed a little to translate it from python to julia.

# First, I need a function that checks if the condition is satisfied for a pair of trees of a specific order.

function SatisfiedForTreesOrder(condition, b, order)
    # Checking the condition for a pair of trees
    for order1 in range(1, order - 1)
        order2 = order - order1
        for tree1 in map(copy, RootedTreeIterator(order1))
            for tree2 in map(copy, RootedTreeIterator(order2))
                if condition(b, tree1, tree2) != true
                    return false
                end
            end
        end
    end
    return true
end

# Now I define the condition needed for the symplecticity.

function SymplecticityCondition(b::TruncatedBSeries, u, v)
    # Defines the condition needed for symplecticity as mentioned in my thesis
    return b[u∘v] + b[v∘u] == b[u] * b[v]
end

# Finally, I can define the function that returns the symplecticity order of a method.

function SymplecticityOrder(b::TruncatedBSeries)
    symporder = 1

    # Checks if the method is consistent
    if b[rootedtree(Int64[])] != 1
        return 0
        
    else

        # This loops checks the symplecticity condition for a pair of trees of a given order
        for i in 1:order(b)
            in(rootedtree(collect(1:i)), keys(b))
            if SatisfiedForTreesOrder(SymplecticityCondition, b, i) == true                        
                symporder = i
            else 
                break 
            end
        end
    end
    return symporder
end

# # Example
# ## Implicit Midpoint Method
# A good example is the Gauß Method with one stage (Implicit Midpoint).
# Since the method is not only pseudo-symplectic but indeed symplectic (means it is of pseudo-symplecticity order $\infty$), I can choose the order of the B-series as high as I want to since the symplecticity order returned by the function will always be the same as the order of the B-series.
